# expense-tracker-api
Project to track transactions

download docker from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

#this project is using postgresql with docker, another databases is suported but I can't garantee that.
#if you dont want use docker, skip this and just create a local database, run the .sql file local and add the conection properties on the file application.properties

after install docker, creat a image for postgresdb.

1- download the postgress image -> 
# docker pull postgres

2- run the line command to run postgress, the -p is the port to port, the first one is the host port the second one is the container port

# docker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="YOUR_PASSWORD" postgres

3- copy the .sql file to the postgres image you just created.
cd C:/where/your/project/is/expense-tracker-api/
# docker cp expense-tracker_db.sql postgresdb:/

4 - run the bash on image->
docker container exec -it postgresdb bash
then run the command line -> 
# psql -U postgres --file expense-tracker_db.sql
